# It doesn't work

A lighthearted reminder that "it doesn't work" isn't helpful when reporting issues or asking for help.

**Live site:** https://it-doesnt-work.com/

## What's This About?

We've all been there. Someone reports a bug with just "it doesn't work" and nothing else. No error messages, no context, no steps to reproduce. 

This site teaches people how to communicate technical problems effectively by showing the difference between vague reports and helpful ones. It provides a simple framework for what information to include when asking for help or reporting issues.

Think of it as a shareable link you can send when someone needs a gentle reminder about describing problems clearly.
